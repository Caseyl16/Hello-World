<p> I am Casey Lindo, a Senior Computer Science Student from <span style="font-weight: bold">Charlotte, North Carolina</span>.
    I was born on june 16, 1998 in Charlotte, North Carolina. I have 1 little sister named Toni who is 13 months younger than me.
    As a kid I loved to play sports. Growing up I ran track, played basketball, football, soccer, and golf. During that time
    I also played the drums from the age of 3 for my church, all the way up through high school where I played for the marching band.
